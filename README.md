# Chinese Number Recognition with Neural Networks
This repository contains a project that uses deep learning techniques to recognize and classify Chinese numbers using a Neural Network (NN). The project is based on a dataset of 15,000 images of Chinese numbers, sourced from Kaggle.
Created for Ngee Ann Polytechnic School of Infocomm Technology ORION Special Interest Group's ICTXLE. This repository was used to introduce Middle School students to the world of Data Science & AI.

## Dataset
![image](https://github.com/ssim3/Chinese-Number-Recognition-NN/assets/93330584/24011d19-fa27-4674-928e-551ce0075295)
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/chinese-mnist) from MNIST comprises 15,000 hand-drawn images of Chinese numbers, which are preprocessed and labeled for use in training and testing the neural network model.

## Key Features
Neural Network Architecture: The repository contains the code for a deep learning model tailored for recognizing Chinese numbers. The architecture consists of 5 layers (Input, 3 Hidden Layers, Output Layer)
Training and Evaluation: The neural network is trained on the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy and categorical crossentropy.
Inference: A function for making predictions on new Chinese number images is included.

Model Performance : 83% Accuracy

## How to Use
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Clone this repository.
Use the provided Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts to train and evaluate the model.
Make predictions on your own Chinese number images.
Dependencies
This project relies on popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, and OpenCV. You may need to install additional Python packages as specified in the requirements file.
